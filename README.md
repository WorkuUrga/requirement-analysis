## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is an important phase in the software development lify cycle(SDLC) that includes identifying, understanding and documenting the specific needs and expectations of the end-user and stakeholders. it acts as a bridge between the initial idea and the final product.

**Importance of Requirement Analysis**

1. **Avoid Miscommunication:**
   Effective communication Ensures a shared understanding of the project scope and goals among the stakeholders and developers which develops clarity and understanding of the project.
2. **Establish Project Scope:**
   Define the boundaries of the system, what it includes, and what it will exclude which helps in preventing project creed.
3. **Cost and Time Estimation**
   Investing time upfront in requirement analysis can significantly reduce costs and time in the later stages of the development. By addressing potential issues early, teams can avoid costly changes and rework that ofter arise from unclear and incomplete requirements.
4. **Enhanced Quality Assurance**
   Requirement Analysis ensures that the final output meets the outlines specifications. The linkage between the requirements and testing helps maintain high quality and functionality in the final product.
5. **Enhanced Project Efficiency**
   Clear and concise requirements streamline the development process and reduce the likelihood of rework.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle for the following reasons:

  - **Minimizes Rework:** When requirements are well understood from the start, the need for rework due to misunderstandings or incomplete specifications is greatly reduced, leading to more efficient project execution.

3. **Enhanced Quality Assurance**
   Requirement analysis lays the groundwork for effective quality assurance by providing a clear basis for testing and validation. Well-documented requirements allow QA teams to create thorough test cases that ensure the software meets user needs.

- **Importance:**

  - **Alignment with User Expectations:** Testing against clearly defined requirements ensures that the final product aligns with what users expect, enhancing user satisfaction.
  - **Facilitates Traceability:** Requirement analysis establishes a traceable relationship between requirements, design, and testing. This traceability allows teams to verify that all requirements have been addressed and helps identify any gaps in functionality.

  ## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

  ### **1. Requirement Gathering**

  This is the initial step in requirement analysis process where informations about the user needs, business goals and system functionalities are collected. This step helps to ensure no crutial information is missed at the start of the project.
  **Common techniques for gathering requirements**

  - **Interviews:** By conducting one to one or group interviews with stakeholders to gather all necessary informations, insights and preferences.
  - **Surveys and Questionnaires:** Distributing surveys to a broader audience to collect quantitative data from a large number of stakeholders on user needs.
  - **Workshops and Brainstorming Sessions:** Facilitating collaborative sessions with stakeholders to brainstorm and discuss requirements.
  - **Observation:** Observing current workflows and processes to identify pain points and areas for improvement.

  ### **2. Requirement Elicitation**

  This step helps in identifying and refining requirements, ensuring that ll relevant aspects are considered before moving forward in the development process.
  **Common techniques for requirement Elicitation**

  - **Interviews:** To understand stakeholder needs and expectations.
  - **Use Cases and User Stories:** Developing scenarios that describe how users will interact with the system, helping to clarify requirements.
  - **Brainstorming:** Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
  - **Prototyping:** Creating early visual representations of the system to facilitate discussions and gather feedback on features and functionalities.
  - **Focus Groups:** Organizing sessions with selected users to discuss their needs and validate ideas.

  ### **3. Requirement Documentation**

  Once requirements are gathered and elicited, they need to be documented in a clear and organized manner. Requirement documentation serves as a formal record of the project's scope and expectations.Proper documentation ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the requirements. It serves as a reference throughout the SDLC, aiding communication and reducing the risk of misunderstandings.

  - **Requirement Specification Document:** Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
  - **User Stories:** Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the userâ€™s perspective.
  - **Use Cases:** Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

  ### **4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling**

  Requirement analysis and modeling involve examining the documented requirements to identify relationships, dependencies, and potential conflicts. This process also includes creating models that represent the system's functionality.

  **Common techniques used**

  - **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):** Visual representations of how data moves through the system, helping to clarify processes and interactions.
  - **Requirement Prioritization:** Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
  - **Feasibility Analysis:** Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
  - **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs):** Models that depict the relationships between different data entities within the system.

  ### **5. Requirement Validation**

  Requirement validation is the process of ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible for implementation. This is typically done through reviews and testing.
  Validating requirements ensures that the project is aligned with stakeholder expectations and reduces the likelihood of costly changes later in the development process.
  It also helps in identifying any misunderstandings or missing requirements before moving into the design and development phases.

  **Common techniques used**

  - **Review Sessions:** Organizing meetings with stakeholders to review and confirm the documented requirements.
  - **Prototyping:** Using prototypes to validate requirements with users, ensuring that their needs are met.
  - **Walkthroughs:** Conducting structured reviews of the requirements with the development and QA teams to identify any issues.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
  - **Traceability:** Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

  ## **Types of Requirements.**

  ### **1. Functional Requirements**

  Functional requirements specify what the system should do. They define the behaviors, features, and functionalities of the software. In the context of the hotel booking management project, functional requirements might include:

  - **Hotel Management System:** A system used for hotel managers/owners to manage their hotel's related information.
  - **Customer Service:**
    - This service enables customers to search for a hotel based
    - Customers are able to book a reservation at the hotel.
    - Customers are able to make payment through a third-party service.
    - Customers are able to get information about nearby hotels, recommendations and offers.
